This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Info about project

As it was mentioned on the email sent to me by Yusdaly, I made a simple wallet view, with static data and a markets carousel which is powered by Binance API service. It has FirebaseAuth which not only allows a user and password sign up and login, but it also allows to sign up and sign in with a Google Account and additionally, I integrated Firestore to fill the data in the table you told me to add. Also it's responsive!

## Important

After logging in, the app will throw an alert. Just change the url to `http://localhost:4200/dashboard` and it'll show the wallet view.
